# HaCoder.py
HaCoder.py is script coded by 16 years old Security Researcher/Pentester. It's using AES Encrypted Traffic between Attacker and Victim, I uploaded backdoor to VirusTotal 30 days ago and it's still Fully Undetectable! If it got detectable, just change AES Key and you are ready to rock again! :)
